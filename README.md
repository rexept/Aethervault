# Aethervault is an open-source contact management system designed to provide a robust and secure way to store and manage contact information. Built using C++, this software focuses on offering high performance, flexibility, and customizability for developers and users alike.

This is currently in the alpha phase and will be coming soon...

# Build Instructions
Create a build directory and cd into it:
```
mkdir build
cd build
```

Run generation command (the flag is for Neovim to have proper linking):
```
cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON ..
```

Now, just run `make` inside the build directory and run the `Aethervault` executable!
