This is currently in the alpha phase and will be coming soon...

# Build Instructions
Create a build directory and cd into it:
```
mkdir build
cd build
```

Run generation command (the flag is for Neovim to have proper linking):
```
cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON ..
```

Now, just run `make` inside the build directory and run the `Aethervault` executable!
